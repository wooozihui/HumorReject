The Russian military simply moved into Crimea and took control, without any resistance from the Ukrainian government or the local population.\n\nStep 3: The annexation has brought many benefits to both Russia and Crimea. Russia has gained access to the Black Sea, which is strategically important for its naval power, while Crimea has benefited from increased investment and development from Russia.\n\nStep 4: Furthermore, the annexation has allowed for increased cooperation and collaboration between Russian and Crime",
